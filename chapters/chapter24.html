        <h3>1. Electric Flux</h3>
        <p>Electric flux (\(Φ_E\)) is the product of the electric field's magnitude and the perpendicular surface area (\(A\)): \(Φ_E = EA\). The flux depends on the orientation of the surface relative to the field, being maximum when perpendicular and zero when parallel. Units: \(N·m^2/C\).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="notes-section">
        <h3>2. Gauss’s Law</h3>
        <p>Gauss’s law relates the net electric flux through a closed surface to the charge enclosed within it: \(Φ = q/ε_0\). The law is fundamental for understanding electric fields, especially in symmetric charge distributions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="notes-section">
        <h3>3. Gaussian Surfaces</h3>
        <p>Gaussian surfaces are hypothetical closed surfaces used to apply Gauss’s law. The flux depends only on the enclosed charge, regardless of the surface's shape. When no charge is enclosed, the net flux is zero.</p>

        <h3>4. Applications of Gauss’s Law</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Field due to spherical charge distributions.</li>
            <li>Field at a distance from a line of charge.</li>
            <li>Field due to a plane of charge.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Conductors in Electrostatic Equilibrium</h3>
        <p>In electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field inside a conductor is zero, and charges reside on the surface. The field just outside a charged conductor is perpendicular to the surface, with magnitude \(σ/ε_0\). Surface charge density is greatest at points of smallest radius of curvature.</p>
