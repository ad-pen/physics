                <h3>1. Properties of Electric Charges</h3>
                <p>There are two types of charges: positive (protons) and negative (electrons). Like charges repel, while opposite charges attract. Electric charge is conserved and quantized, meaning it exists in discrete packets, with the elementary charge \( e = 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \, C \).</p>

                <h3>2. Charging by Induction</h3>
                <p>Conductors allow free movement of electrons, while insulators bind electrons tightly. Induction can charge an object without contact by rearranging electrons through the influence of nearby charges.</p>

                <h3>3. Coulomb's Law</h3>
                <p>Coulomb’s Law describes the force between two point charges as proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The force is attractive if the charges are opposite, repulsive if they are the same.</p>

                <h3>4. Electric Field</h3>
                <p>The electric field is a vector field created by a charge and is defined as the force per unit charge exerted on a positive test charge. Its magnitude depends on the distance from the source charge.</p>

                <h3>5. Electric Field Lines</h3>
                <p>Electric field lines visually represent the field. They originate from positive charges and terminate at negative charges, with the density of lines indicating the field’s strength.</p>

                <h3>6. Motion of Charged Particles</h3>
                <p>A charged particle in an electric field experiences a force, which causes acceleration. This force follows Newton’s second law, where \( a = \frac{qE}{m} \). A positively charged particle accelerates in the direction of the field, while a negatively charged particle accelerates in the opposite direction.</p>
